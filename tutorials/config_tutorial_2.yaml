# CrocoCamp Configuration for Tutorial 2  
# ==========================================
# This configuration file contains paths and settings for Tutorial 2,
# which demonstrates model-observation comparison using MOM6 and a single Argo float.
#
# See config_template.yaml for more info about each field.
#
# NOTE: Paths below are pre-configured for NCAR HPC systems (Casper/Derecho).
# If running elsewhere, you will need to adjust these paths to your local setup.

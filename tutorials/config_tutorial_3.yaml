# CrocoCamp Configuration for Tutorial 1
# ==========================================
# This configuration file contains paths and settings for Tutorial 1,
# which demonstrates model-observation comparison using MOM6 and World Ocean Database.
#
# See config_template.yaml for more info about each field.
# 
# NOTE: Paths below are pre-configured for NCAR HPC systems (Casper/Derecho).
# If running elsewhere, you will need to adjust these paths to your local setup.

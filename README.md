# CrocoCamp

**CrocoCamp** is a Python toolset for comparing ocean model outputs and observation datasets. It streamlines workflows for interpolating model data into the observation space, producing tabular data in Parquet format ready for analysis and interactive visualization.

**New in December 2025:** CrocoCamp now supports **ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System)** in addition to MOM6, with a flexible model adapter architecture that enables easy extension to other ocean models. The new architecture abstracts model-specific operations (file I/O, unit conversions, configuration requirements) into dedicated adapters, making the codebase more maintainable and extensible.

## Installation

### Prerequisites and Dependencies

DART (Data Assimilation Research Testbed) is required to run the `perfect_model_obs` executable, which interpolates MOM6 ocean model output onto the observation space provided in obs_seq.in format. In the context of this workshop, DART is already pre-compiled both on Derecho and Casper. If you are interested in the installation on other operating systems or more detailed information, see the [DART documentation](https://docs.dart.ucar.edu/).

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone CrocoCamp
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CROCODILE-CESM/CrocoCamp.git
cd CrocoCamp/install
```

#### 2. Configure Environment Paths

Copy the template file and edit it to set your DART installation path and conda environment name:

```bash
cp envpaths.sh.template envpaths.sh
```

Edit `envpaths.sh` to set:
- `DART_ROOT_PATH`: Path to your DART installation (e.g., `/path/to/DART/`)
- `CONDA_ENV_NAME`: Name for your conda environment (e.g., `crococamp`)

**Note for NCAR HPC Users:** You can use the pre-configured `envpaths_NCAR.sh` and `install_NCAR.sh` which are already set up with NCAR-specific paths.

#### 3. Run Installation Script

Create the conda environment and configure paths:

```bash
./install.sh
```

To also download tutorial datasets from Zenodo:
```bash
./install.sh --tutorial
```

#### 4. Activate the Environment

```bash
conda activate crococamp  # or your chosen environment name
```

The installation script will:
- Create a conda environment from `environment.yml`
- Configure the environment to load DART paths automatically when activated
- Set up Python paths for CrocoLake observation converters
- Register a Jupyter kernel for the environment
- Optionally download tutorial datasets (with `--tutorial` flag)

## Getting Started

The best way to learn CrocoCamp is through the hands-on tutorials in the `tutorials/` folder. These Jupyter notebooks guide you through:

**Tutorial 1** (`tutorial1_MOM6-CL-comparison.ipynb`): 
- Setting up a basic model-observation comparison workflow
- Using MOM6 ocean model output and CrocoLake observations
- Visualizing results with the interactive map widget

**Tutorial 2** (`tutorial2_MOM6-CL-comparison-float.ipynb`):
- Generating custom observation files from CrocoLake 
- Analyzing single Argo float profiles
- Using the interactive profile widget for vertical profile comparisons
- Passing custom configurations to profile and map widgets

These tutorials demonstrate:
- Loading and configuring workflows with `WorkflowModelObs`
- Running the complete processing pipeline
- Exploring results including diagnostic values such as:
  - `residual` (obs - model)
  - `abs_residual` (absolute residual)
  - `normalized_residual` (residual normalized by observation error)
  - `squared_residual` (squared residual)
  - `log_likelihood` (log-likelihood of model-observation fit)

## Configuration

Edit the provided `configs/config_template.yaml` to set your input, output, and model/obs paths. The template file contains all necessary configuration options with detailed comments.

**Important:** You must specify the `ocean_model` field in your configuration file to select the appropriate model adapter:
```yaml
ocean_model: MOM6  # or ROMS
```

Different ocean models may require different configuration keys. For example:
- **MOM6** requires: `model_files_folder`, `perfect_model_obs_dir`, and standard MOM6 grid files
- **ROMS** requires: `roms_filename`, `layer_name`, `model_state_variables`, and ROMS-specific grid files

**Note for NCAR HPC Users:** The paths in the provided configuration files and some paths used in the tutorial notebooks are pre-configured for resources available on NCAR's High Performance Computing systems, including:
- CrocoLake observation dataset paths
- DART tools paths 
- Pre-compiled `perfect_model_obs` executable locations
These paths need to be adjusted if running on other systems.
Note that DART needs to be compiled separately on Derecho and Casper, so we provide two pre-compiled paths for the workshop:
- Derecho: `/glade/u/home/emilanese/work/CROCODILE-DART-fork/models/MOM6/work`
- Casper: `/glade/u/home/emilanese/work/DART-Casper/models/MOM6/work`

### Observation Types Configuration

CrocoCamp supports automatic configuration of [observation types for DART]([url](https://github.com/NCAR/DART/blob/main/observations/forward_operators/obs_def_ocean_mod.rst)) assimilation through the `use_these_obs` field in your configuration file.

#### Using specific observation types

You need to specify at least one observation type to use, and that needs to be in your observation sequence files header.

Specify your desired observation types in the `use_these_obs` field in `config.yaml`, for example:

```yaml
# Basic observation types
use_these_obs:
  - FLOAT_TEMPERATURE
  - FLOAT_SALINITY
  - CTD_TEMPERATURE
  - CTD_SALINITY
```

This would interpolate MOM6 model results to all observations marked with the same verbatim type in the provided observation sequence files.

#### ALL_<FIELD> Syntax

You can use the `ALL_<FIELD>` syntax to automatically include all observation types for a specific quantity, for example:

```yaml
use_these_obs:
  - ALL_TEMPERATURE    # Includes all temperature-related obs types
  - ALL_SALINITY       # Includes all salinity-related obs types  
```

In this case, CrocoCamp builds a dictionary of all the supported temperature and salinity observation types in DART, and will look for all of those types in the observation sequence files you provided.

### Time window

The `time_window` field in the configuration file determines the temporal range over which model and observation sequence files are matched. For example, for a model file that contains daily averages for the date 2025-10-01 12:00 and observation sequence file that contains observations between 2025-09-30 10:00 and 2025-10-01 23:00, the time window must be 52 hours or larger to interpolate the model onto the observations in the observation file. The time window is centered on the model date, so 26 hours on each side would span the time between 2025-09-30 10:00 and 2025-10-02 14:00, including all the observations. Note that it's an 'all or nothing' approach: if only one observation is not inside the time window, the whole file is skipped and no observation is used.

In pseudo code:
```
tw                 # provided time window
tm                 # model date
to_1               # minimum observation time in observation sequence file
to_2               # minimum observation time in observation sequence file
tm_1 = tm - tw/2   # lower bound for matching
tm_2 = tm + tw/2   # higher bound for matching
if (tm_1 <= to_1 <= tm_2) and (tm_1 <= to_2 <= tm_2):
    interpolate the model onto this observation sequence file
else:
    skip and check next observation sequence file (if any)
```

## Architecture

## Usage

### Programmatic Usage (Class-based API, e.g for Jupyter notebooks)

For Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks, use the class-based API:

```python
from crococamp.workflows import WorkflowModelObs

# Load workflow from configuration file
workflow = WorkflowModelObs.from_config_file("config.yaml")

# Or create workflow with config dictionary directly in code
# Example for MOM6:
config_mom6 = {
    'ocean_model': 'MOM6',
    'model_files_folder': '/path/to/model/files',
    'obs_seq_in_folder': '/path/to/obs_seq_in/files', 
    'output_folder': '/path/to/output',
    'template_file': '/path/to/template.nc',
    'static_file': '/path/to/static.nc',
    'ocean_geometry': '/path/to/geometry.nc',
    'perfect_model_obs_dir': '/path/to/perfect_model_obs',
    'parquet_folder': '/path/to/parquet'
}
workflow = WorkflowModelObs(config_mom6)

# Example for ROMS:
config_roms = {
    'ocean_model': 'ROMS',
    'roms_filename': '/path/to/roms_avg.nc',
    'obs_seq_in_folder': '/path/to/obs_seq_in/files',
    'output_folder': '/path/to/output',
    'template_file': '/path/to/template.nc',
    'static_file': '/path/to/static.nc',
    'ocean_geometry': '/path/to/geometry.nc',
    'layer_name': 's_rho',
    'model_state_variables': {'temp': 'QTY_POTENTIAL_TEMPERATURE', 'salt': 'QTY_SALINITY'},
    'parquet_folder': '/path/to/parquet'
}
workflow = WorkflowModelObs(config_roms)

# Run the complete workflow
files_processed = workflow.run(trim_obs=True, no_matching=False)

# Or run specific steps
files_processed = workflow.process_files(trim_obs=True)
workflow.merge_model_obs_to_parquet(trim_obs=True)
```

You can also override configuration values:

```python
# Override config values when creating workflow
workflow = WorkflowModelObs.from_config_file(
    "config.yaml", 
    output_folder="/custom/output/path",
    trim_obs=True
)

# Or modify configuration after creation
workflow.set_config("parquet_folder", "/custom/parquet/path")

# Access configuration values
output_folder = workflow.get_config("output_folder") 
workflow.print_config()  # Print all current configuration

# Get required configuration keys for validation
required_keys = workflow.get_required_config_keys()

workflow.run()
```

### Command Line Interface

Process model-observation pairs using the main CLI:

```bash
# Basic usage
perfect-model-obs -c config.yaml

# With observation trimming to model grid boundaries
perfect-model-obs -c config.yaml --trim

# Skip time matching (assumes 1:1 file correspondence)
perfect-model-obs -c config.yaml --no-matching

# Convert existing outputs to parquet only
perfect-model-obs -c config.yaml --parquet-only
```

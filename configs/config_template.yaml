# CrocoCamp Configuration Template
# ==========================================
# 
# This template file provides comprehensive configuration options for CrocoCamp workflows.
# It includes detailed explanations for each parameter to help oceanography students
# understand the purpose and usage of each setting.
#
# Usage: Copy this file to create your own configuration, then modify paths and
# parameters according to your specific data and analysis requirements.

####### INPUT FILES #######
# Input directory containing model .nc files to process
# This should contain time-series NetCDF files from your ocean model (e.g., MOM6)
model_files_folder: /path/to/model_files/

# Model configuration files (must be .nc files)
# These files define the model grid structure and properties:
# - template_file: Contains model variable definitions and metadata
# - static_file: Contains time-independent model fields 
# - ocean_geometry: Contains grid geometry (lat/lon coordinates, cell areas, etc.)
template_file: /path/to/template_file.nc
static_file: /path/to/static_file.nc
ocean_geometry: /path/to/ocean_geometry.nc

# Directory containing observation files
# This should contain DART obs_seq.in format files with observation data
obs_seq_in_folder: /path/to/obs/

####### OUTPUT FILES #######
# Output directories for processed files (will be created if they don't exist)
# These directories will store the various outputs from the workflow:

# Main output directory for obs_seq.out files (model data interpolated to obs locations)
output_folder: $WORK/2025-Crocodile-Workshop/tutorial_1/out_obs_seq_in/

# Backup directory for DART input.nml configuration files  
input_nml_bck: $WORK/2025-Crocodile-Workshop/tutorial_1/input_bckp/

# Directory for observation files trimmed to model grid boundaries (if --trim option used)
trimmed_obs_folder: $WORK/2025-Crocodile-Workshop/tutorial_1/out_trimmed_obs_seq_in/

# Directory for final parquet files containing merged model-observation comparisons
# This is where the analysis-ready data will be stored for visualization
parquet_folder: $WORK/2025-Crocodile-Workshop/tutorial_1/out_parquet/

####### DART #######
# Path to DART's perfect model obs executable
# This should point to the compiled DART MOM6 work directory
perfect_model_obs_dir: /path/to/DART/models/MOM6/work/

# Observation types to assimilate (can include ALL_<FIELD> entries)
# These define which observation types to include in the analysis:
# - Individual types: specific observation platforms/instruments
# - ALL_<FIELD>: automatic expansion to include all obs types for a quantity
use_these_obs:
   - ALL_TEMPERATURE           # Includes ALL temperature types (FLOAT_TEMPERATURE, CTD_TEMPERATURE, etc.)
#  - FLOAT_TEMPERATURE          # Argo float temperature measurements
#  - FLOAT_SALINITY            # Argo float salinity measurements

# Time window for matching observations to model output
# This defines the temporal tolerance for pairing observations with model data
# Larger windows allow more observations to be matched but may reduce temporal accuracy
time_window:
  days: 999      # Primary time window in days (999 = very large window for testing)
  hours: 0       # Additional hours to add to the time window
  minutes: 0     # Additional minutes to add to the time window
  seconds: 0     # Additional seconds to add to the time window
  weeks: 0       # Additional weeks (converted to days automatically)
  months: 0      # Additional months (converted to days, ~30 days/month)
  years: 0       # Additional years (converted to days, ~365 days/year)

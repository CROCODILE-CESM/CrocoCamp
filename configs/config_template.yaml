# ==========================================
# CrocoCamp Configuration Template 
# ==========================================
# This template file contains all the necessary configuration parameters for running
# CrocoCamp model-observation comparison workflows. Copy this file and modify the 
# paths below to match your local system setup.
#
# For more details, see the README.md file and tutorial notebooks.

# Ocean model to use (required - determines which adapter is used)
# Supported values: MOM6, ROMS
ocean_model: MOM6

####### INPUT FILES #######
# Directory containing model output files (.nc format) that you want to
# compare with observations
model_files_folder: /path/to/model_files/

# Model configuration files (all must be .nc files from your model simulation)
# template_file: Any one of your model output files (used to read grid structure and time info)
# static_file: Model static file containing time-invariant grid information
# ocean_geometry: Model ocean geometry file containing grid cell areas, volumes, etc.
template_file: /path/to/template_file
static_file: /path/to/static_file
ocean_geometry:  /path/to/ocean_geometry

# Directory containing observation files in DART observation sequence format
obs_seq_in_folder: /path/to/obs/

####### OUTPUT FILES #######
# Output directories for processed files (will be created automatically if they don't exist)
# output_folder: Where perfect_model_obs results will be stored (obs_seq.out files)
# input_nml_bck: Backup location for DART input.nml configuration files
# trimmed_obs_folder: Location for observation files trimmed to model grid boundaries
# parquet_folder: Final output location for processed model-observation comparison data
# tmp_folder: Folder to store temporary files
output_folder: $WORK/CrocoCamp_output/workflow_1/out_obs_seq_in/
input_nml_bck: $WORK/CrocoCamp_output/workflow_1/input_bckp/
trimmed_obs_folder: $WORK/CrocoCamp_output/workflow_1/out_trimmed_obs_seq_in/
parquet_folder: $WORK/CrocoCamp_output/workflow_1/out_parquet/
tmp_folder: $WORK/CrocoCamp_output/workflow_1/tmp/

####### DART CONFIGURATION #######
# Path to DART's perfect_model_obs executable directory: it should point to your
# compiled DART/models/<MODEL>/work directory (e.g., MOM6 or ROMS_rutgers)

perfect_model_obs_dir: /path/to/DART/models/MOM6/work/

# Observation types to include in the comparison
# You can use specific types (e.g., FLOAT_TEMPERATURE) or groups (e.g.,
# ALL_TEMPERATURE); the ALL_ syntax automatically includes all observation types
# for that quantity
use_these_obs:
   - ALL_TEMPERATURE           # Includes ALL temperature observation types (Argo, CTD, XBT, etc.)
   # Other examples:
   # - ALL_SALINITY            # Includes ALL salinity observation types  
   # - FLOAT_TEMPERATURE       # Include only float temperature measurements
   # - FLOAT_SALINITY          # Include only float salinity measurements

# Time window for matching observations to model output
# This determines how close in time observations need to be to model output for interpolation
time_window:
  days: 999      # Primary time window in days (999 = very loose matching)
  hours: 0       # Additional hours
  minutes: 0     # Additional minutes
  seconds: 0     # Additional seconds
  weeks: 0       # Additional weeks
  months: 0      # Additional months (30 days/month)
  years: 0       # Additional years (365 days/year)
